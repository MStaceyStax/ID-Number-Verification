 The Junior Mentor Program 2025 Project #2 ID - Number-Verification System 

Project: The objective of the ID Number Verification Project was to create a project that can determain whether the ID Number is valid or invalid. In this case, the below parameters were advised:
Features: 
Have you ever wondered how most systems know you have typed the wrong ID number even when you have typed in 13 digit numbers?
Well there are some small things they are checking for and in this project we will be applying some of those.
The idea of the project is really simple, you ask the user to enter their ID number then you tell them if the ID Number they have entered is Valid or Not
Check for this things in the ID:
 
1. is is 13 digits long
2. Does it only have numbers
3. is the date of birth correct (eg Month not exceeding 12, etc)
4. 10th Number of the ID represents the Gender of the person (>=5 is male, <5 is female) 
5. 11th Number of the ID must be 0 or 1 (0 meaning SA citizen, 1 meaning not citizen)
6. 12th Number is usually 8 for historical reasons but for now lets just accept 8, so if not 8 its not valid for our application (this does not apply for all ID numbers)
7. If the ID number is Valid, print on the screen and say the ID is valid, also print the persons date of birth, (Not like numbers, but something like this "06 March 2001", Note the Month must be in words), also print their Gender and Citizenship
8. If the ID number is Not Valid, just print "Invalid ID Number" and keep asking the user to enter the correct ID number until they enter one that is valid

Tech Stack - Python

The Process - I started by researching the different methods to build the project as well as the making use of the functions like "strings: and "loops" to incorporate within the code. After evaluating the project,  I then conceptualize it and planned as follows:
The program verifies the validity of an ID number based on the Luhn alogorithm. It checks if the ID number is 13 digits Long, characters are digits and if the ID number is valid. The program will prompt the user to enter an ID number and check if it is valid according to the Luhn algorithm.

Lessons Learnt - Planning out your projects helps with structure and figuring out what needs to go where and then also applying the same. Understaing how code works is just or even more important. Once you have learnt a concept with code, apply it by using it in a project. 

Areas of improvements - Furthering my learning of Python

Overall Growth - From working on this project, I started gain confience in my tech ability.
